debathena-dotfiles (10.0.0-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge in quilt patches.  These and other changes are summarized below.
  * Remove platform-specific code for non-Linux architectures.
  * Remove mksessiondirs and other ATHENA_SESSION_TMPDIr code; this is now
    handled by pam_mktemp
  * Run from.debathena and quota.debathena rather than from/quota in case
    debathena-from-config/debathena-quota-config are not installed
  * Remove unecessary athena/ from paths, except in prototype files which
    should remain unchanged for compatability.
  * Remove ancient extend alias from tcsh dotfiles.
  * Set ZEPHYR_CLIENT to not run zwgc on dialups; this avoids problems
    with zephyr in Debian automatically gaining focus.
  * Remove code for handling temporary home directories, since those can't
    happen anymore.
  * Stop setting XDG_DATA_DIRS; this is now controlled by debathena-desktop-config.
  * Stop setting COREDUMPSIZE; this was an IRIX workaround
  * Stop setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /usr/athena/lib; this breaks building
    things when /usr/athena is a symlink.
  * Stop setting XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to a directory that doesn't exist.
  * Change renew alias to use 'kinit -54' so we no longer require modified
    Kerberos.
  * Stop setting MANPATH, since we'd be setting it to the default anyway.
  * Remove athena_path logic, since athena_path would be PATH.
  * Only have one copy of the add alias, now that athena_path is gone.
  * Remove add_flags since it is always empty.
  * Don't temporarily remove add in cshrc.
  * Stop setting CDPATH.
  * Stop changing the default prompt for bash; the Debian default is better.
  * Stop changing the default prompt for tcsh, but leave the prompt
    character change, since there's a lot of documentation that uses it.
  * Stop configuring tcsh to not stat /afs/* when tab-completing; fakestat handles this.
  * Remove tcsh warning for "bind" alias.
